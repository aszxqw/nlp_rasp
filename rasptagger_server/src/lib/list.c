   Statistical labeller: sorted list handler.

   2-1-92	Created

   Principal external functions:
	list_search
	list_add
	list_search_and_add
	list_search_and_check

   Functions for handling sorted linked lists. The basic idea is to adopt
   data structures to have a next pointer as their first field, and to
   compare on the object that follows according to a user supplied ordering
   function, which is passed pointers to such objects and returns <= 0, 0
   or >= 0 is the same way that strcmp etc. would.

   All objects and entries in the list are passed as pointers, cast to
   (void *). It is assumed that the "next" pointer is the first element of a
   member of a list, and the comparison field follows. Compare functions are
   called with pointers to two comparison fields.

/* The archetypal list structure. NB! Code here must never find the address of
the key field by saying &(l->key) because if the actual key field is larger
than a standard Key it does not work with some compilers. Instead use l + 1.

    list_search

    Search the list for the given object. head is the location of the head
    of the list. compar is called with the a pointer to key and a pointer
    to a key field from the list, and returns -1, 0 or 1 in the manner of
    strcmp. If the object is found, a pointer to it is returned and the
    found flag is set to TRUE. Otherwise, a pointer to the preceding member
    of the list is returned, with a flag of FALSE. In either case, a pointer
    to the next element is also returned. For an insert at the head of the
    list, the pointer to the preceding member is NULL.

    Called with a pointer to the next field of the previous element (or a
    pointer to a variable containing the address of the list), and the next
    field, this allocates space and inserts a c_new member into the list. The
    remaining field must be set up by the client. "text" is used for errors.
