   Statistical labeller - stack management

   04-01-93	Created
   28-01-93	Revision of the main structures for phrasal and special
		tagging.
   09-02-93	Further substantial change to data structures.
   01-04-93	Change from FSMs to parser
   21-04-93	Move towards chart data structure
   06-05-93	Revised the hypothesis structure

   A "stack" is a collection of lexemes, with their associated nodes.

   The data structures used in tagging are complex and include some degree of
   redundancy; the latter represents a trade-off in the complexity of the data
   structures against the complexity of the code. The main data structures
   are:

   node: main data structure ovre which tagging occurs.
   lexeme: data structure for words read from input.
   link: lists of hypotheses.
   shyp: hypotheses which have an associated score from a tagging algorithm. 
   hyp: basic hypothesis (tag) information.

   A hyp may be shared between more than one shyp: it may be both the lexical
   hypothesis of a word, and part of a phrase, or it may be part of more than
   one phrase, or it may be both a top level phrase and part of another
   phrase.

   A shyp may be shared between more than one link: it may appear on the start
   list of one node and the end list of another, or on both the start and end
   lists of the same node (however, it has at most these two links to it).

   Links are never shared.

/* ----------Node ----------
   The principal data structure used in labelling. The main purpose of a node
   structure is to point to lists of hypotheses starting and ending here, and
   to indicates where the next and previous nodes are.

   We use the term "lexical node" for a node which was created when a word was
   read, and which is linked to the Lexeme entry for that word.

   Nodes are placed in a two way list linked on the pred and succ fields. In
   nodes representing the span of a phrase, the predecessor of the first node
   and the successor of the last one are NULL.
